<h1>ColorTactics</h1>

This is a React-based, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a fun twist—customizable colors! <br>
Players can personalize their experience by choosing the colors for X and O, with dynamic color changes throughout the game to enhance the visual feedback.

- <b>Custom Colors for X and O:</b> At the start of the game, users can select their preferred colors for X and O, adding a personalized element to the gameplay.
 
- <b>Turn Indicator with Dynamic Toggle:</b> The game features a toggle that visually indicates the current player’s    turn. The toggle smoothly moves left or right and changes color to reflect the player’s choice.<br>
	    -	When it’s X’s turn, the toggle and the game box’s shadow will switch to X’s chosen color.<br>
	    -	When it’s O’s turn, the toggle and game box shadow will update to O’s selected color.	
     
-	<b>Win Indication:</b><br>
	    -	If a player wins, the toggle will announce the winner, and both the toggle and the game box’s shadow will change to the color chosen by the winning player.<br>
	    -	The winning grid cells will also be highlighted in the winner’s color, visually marking the victory.
     
-	<b>Draw Scenario:</b> If the game ends in a draw, the toggle will indicate “Draw” and both the toggle and the game box’s shadow will switch to a default color set in the code.

This customizable color Tic-Tac-Toe game enhances the classic experience with a visually engaging, reactive interface!
